## 🌍 Overview

<div align="center">

> **"Where NASA meets Agriculture, Intelligence meets Innovation"**

</div>

Climate change is destabilizing agriculture worldwide, leaving farmers vulnerable to unpredictable rainfall, droughts, floods, and pests. While NASA satellites already generate critical datasets on soil moisture, precipitation, and crop health, this information is often locked in complex scientific formats, inaccessible to the very people who need it most.

<div align="center">

**⚠️ The Critical Challenge ⚠️**

*Billions in crop losses • Rising food insecurity • Preventable human tragedies*

</div>

**🛰️ RootSource** addresses this gap by transforming NASA's Earth observation data into localized, actionable, and farmer-friendly insights. Built as the world's first NASA-powered AI agricultural exploration game and decision-support system, RootSource combines real-time datasets from **SMAP**, **GPM**, **MODIS**, **GLDAS**, **LANDSAT**, **GRACE**, and **POWER** with a gamified learning experience and multilingual AI advisor.
